## How to use

Install it and run:

```sh
yarn
yarn run dev
```

## The idea behind the code

The project uses [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js), which is a framework for server-rendered React apps.
It includes `@mui/material` and its peer dependencies, including `emotion`, the default style engine in MUI v5. If you prefer, you can [use styled-components instead](https://mui.com/material-ui/guides/interoperability/#styled-components).
